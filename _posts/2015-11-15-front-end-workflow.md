title: "Front End Workflow"
---

Back in October I did a presentation on front end workflow at [StripeCon](https://stripecon.eu/).

I started out by looking at my own history with web design and development. It's amazing how far we've come since the early pre-CSS days, tables, Fireworks, Flash etc.

The main part of the talk covered how my design and development tools and techniques have changed dramatically over the past few years - Sketch, Invision, Git, virtual machines, dependency management, CSS pre-processors, BEM and so on. I also talked about how I structure projects and my Grunt workflow.
