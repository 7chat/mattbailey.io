<p></p>
<p>I consider myself to have an interest in films (or is that ‘movies’?). Not so much mainstream cinema fare, but more often than not cult movies, horror, world cinema, older stuff from the 70s and 80s and so on.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve found some fantastic podcasts that help me feed my obsession, so I thought I’d share them with you.</p>

<p>So, without further ado and in no particular order…</p>
<h3>Chris and Phil Present</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“A lighthearted look at the world of movies. Insightful, intelligent film reviews and nonsensical chatter from Brighton‘s finest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest I listen to Chris and Phil more for the humorous banter than the actual film reviews. They have a great rapport together, with Phil brilliantly coming across as a put-upon, long suffering reviewer, subject to the tyranny and dry wit of Chris. However, far too much cake eating goes on!</p>

<h3>The Empire Podcast</h3>
<p>Yes this is a bit mainstream, but as a long-time subscriber to the mag it’s been enjoyable getting to know some of the team through the magical medium of audio. I enjoy the format, comprising of listeners questions, news and interviews. I also like the fact that the team rotate, so there are different folks to listen to each week.</p>

<h3>Horroretc Podcast</h3>
<p>Ok, don’t be put off by the name. These guys aren’t just about horror and when they do talk about it, it’s always intelligent and interesting. The subject matter they cover really is broad, from Giallo, to Lovecraft, to Hitchcock and even TV shows, such as Dexter and The Walking Dead. Occasionally they even do a book show, which they should do more often in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Tony and Ted (and sometimes Dug) really are some of the nicest guys you will probably never meet (they’re all the way over the atlantic in Canada - somewhere I would really like to visit one day).</p>

<h3>Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo’s Film Reviews</h3>
<p>Another mainstream one, but you can’t really call yourself a film fan and ignore it. Mark and Simon are the Dons of the film review world as far as I’m concerned. They’re like the Homer and Marge Simpson, the Ross and Rachel, the Clark Kent and Lois Lane (you get the idea) of the podcast world.</p>
<p>If you’ve never heard Mark’s infamous Pirates Of The Caribbean 3 rant (it goes on for 10 minutes and I don’t think he actually takes a breath!), track it down now!… Actually I’ll give you a hand - <a href="http://youtu.be/FYfbc1B-i4I">here it is on YouTube</a>.</p>

<h3>Mondo Movie</h3>
<p><strong>Mondo</strong> - <em>Extreme in degree or nature</em></p>
<p>That definition says it all really. Sadly Ben and Dan are no longer doing the podcast (although apparently it may return), but the back catalogue is still available on iTunes, all 117 episodes! If you have any interest in cult movies, world cinema, horror, exploitation or genre you need to check this out.</p>

<h3>Yeah It’s That Bad</h3>
<p>These guys arrived on the scene a couple of years ago with a fantastic concept - to re-evaluate movies on Rotten Tomatoes and ask “is it really that bad?”. Most of the movies really are a pile of c**p, but occasionally a gem turns up (Constantine anyone?).</p>
<p>However, it’s the brilliant rapport between the hosts, Joel, Kevin, and Martin (other than that their identities remain a mystery…), that makes this worth listening to. Some people (i.e. non-Americans <em>winky face</em>) may find their constant guffawing a bit grating, but I find it somewhat endearing.</p>

<p><strong>And there you have it, my current, favourite film podcasts.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to recommend any that I’m missing out on please let me know. Probably the best place to get my attention is on <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattbailey">Twitter</a>, but you can also leave a comment below.</p>
<p>Happy listening!</p>
<h3><em>*Update</em> - You Total Cult</h3>
<p>Deserving of an honourable mention is <a href="http://www.chrisandphilpresent.co.uk/blogs/youtotalcult/">You Total Cult</a>, the ‘bastard love child’ of <a href="http://www.chrisandphilpresent.co.uk/category/podcasts/">Chris and Phil Present</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From a dank dark Brighton basement two groan men chat and argue about classic cult favourites, unmade masterpieces and obscure films that they probably had no business watching in the first place.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‘ve only listened to the first few episodes and haven’t been able to form a proper opinion yet, but so far I like what I’m hearing.</p>
