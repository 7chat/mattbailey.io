title: Say Hello To My Shiny New Site
---

My old Tumblr blog served me well, but I've been wanting a bit more control for a long time. Say hello to my shiny new, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) powered site!

It's nice to finally have complete control over the code and style, and it's 'self-hosted' by those wonderful folks over at [Site5](http://www.site5.com/in.php?id=107430). It's still a work-in-progress, so expect to see things change from time-to-time.

If you want to find out more about the tech specs of the site check out the [About Me](/about-me) page. If you have any comments, questions or feedback use the form below.
