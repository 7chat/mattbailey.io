<h2>CSS preprocessors rock, fact!</h2>
<p>As a long time <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> user I don’t need any convincing about the benefits of CSS pre-processors. If you’re not using one already you really should be - my productivity has increased exponentially as a result. I’ve used <strong>LESS</strong> on all of <a href="http://www.gpmd.co.uk/">GPMD</a>’s projects since I started working here; <a href="http://www.thewatchgallery.co.uk/">The Watch Gallery</a>, <a href="http://www.barnardlevit.co.uk/">Barnard Levit</a> and <a href="http://www.buddshirts.co.uk/">Budd Shirts</a> to name a few.</p>

<h2>LESS or SASS?</h2>
<p><strong>LESS</strong> has played a major part in our front-end design process through the use of fantastic frameworks and tools such as <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://semantic.gs/">The Semantic Grid System</a>. I’ve been aware of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> for about as long as <strong>LESS</strong> (maybe even longer) but for a number of reasons I’ve never gone down that path. The main reason for me is that <strong>LESS</strong> seemed a bit more approachable - It has a nice, easy-to-follow website, and it doesn’t require any arcane knowledge of <strong>ruby gems</strong> (say what!?) or command-line-fu.</p>
<h2>Command line fears</h2>
<p>However, even though I’m a designer first and foremost, as time has gone by I’ve started using the command line more and more. <strong>Git</strong> is now a staple part of my daily diet, and I’ve started looking more into front-end process automation (see my article on <a href="http://blog.mattbailey.co/post/45519082789/a-beginners-guide-to-grunt">Grunt</a> for beginners). My plan is to build on the front-end process here at <strong>GPMD</strong>, introducing tools such as <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> - comprising of <strong>Yo</strong> for scaffolding, <strong>Bower</strong> for dependency management, and <strong>Grunt</strong> for the build process.</p>
<p>As a result of all this other command line ‘stuff’ I’m exposing myself to, I’m finding myself not so scared of the command line any more, and honestly, installing and using <strong>SASS</strong> really isn’t that tricky. In fact, if you don’t want to touch the command line you don’t have to - just download <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> (if you’re on a Mac - Not sure if there’s an equivalent Win/Linux app?), write your <strong>SASS</strong>, and let <strong>CodeKit</strong> do all the hard work!</p>
<h2>But even so, why change from LESS to SASS?</h2>
<p>Firstly, let me just set the record straight - <strong>LESS</strong> works for me. It does everything I want it to do, and does it well. If you’re already using <strong>LESS</strong> and are happy with it then don’t feel pressured to change - not only is it brilliant, but it’s in active development so will be around for the foreseeable future! But just because something works doesn’t mean there isn’t something better you could use - I don’t agree with the old adage <em>“if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”</em> - that’s totally counter intuitive to progress people!</p>
<p>I’m also not ashamed to admit that I’m easily influenced. In order to stay in touch with the web design world at large I listen to quite a few design/front-end podcasts. Overwhelmingly most of the designers/front-end devs that I admire and respect (I’m talking the <strong>Chris Coyiers</strong> of this world) are using <strong>SASS</strong>. I want to see what all the fuss is about, and I don’t want to be left behind - that’s just me.</p>
<p><strike>I’m also aware that <strong>SASS</strong> is more ‘powerful’ than <strong>LESS</strong>, with added coolness such as nesting media queries, proper logic and looping capabilities, the ability to @extend styles and so on. Although this hasn’t been an issue for me yet, I can see a time when some of these things will probably prove to be incredibly useful.</strike>*</p>
<p><strong>*Update, 3 Aug 2013:</strong> As <a href="https://twitter.com/gorkamolero" title="Gorka Molero" target="_blank">@Gorka</a> points out in the comments below, as of v1.4.0&#160;<strong>LESS</strong> now supports nested media queries, looping (of sorts), extends and so on.</p>
<h2>Gettin&#8217; sassy with SASS</h2>
<p>So the long and short of it is this: <strong>SASS</strong> is something I’ve been flirting with for ages - <em>a little nudge here and a little wink there</em> - and I’ve finally drummed up the courage to ask her out on a date! I’m a little apprehensive, but excited, and I have a good feeling about this relationship. Wish me luck, and I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes!</p>
