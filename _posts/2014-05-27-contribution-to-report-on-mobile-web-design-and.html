<p>Recently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markslocock" title="Mark Slocock - Managing Director, GPMD">Mark</a>Â and I were both excited, and flattered, to be asked to contribute to an in-depth report on mobile web design and development best practice.</p>

<p><span>My task was to write about creating and maintaining a responsive codebase. This was not only a challenge, but a great way for me to put in writing a lot of the learning and development I&#8217;ve been going through over the past couple of years. The specific areas I covered were:</span></p>
<ul><li><span>How does a responsive codebase work?</span></li>
<li><span>What do developers need to do to create a responsive codebase that is different to non-responsive?</span></li>
<li><span>How do you maintain a responsive codebase/What is good housekeeping?</span></li>
<li><span>How do you validate the code?</span></li>
<li><span>How do you optimise to ensure it&#8217;s efficient for performance/page speed?</span></li>
</ul><p><span>If you have an econsultancy subscription you can </span><span></span><a href="https://econsultancy.com/reports/mobile-web-design-and-development-best-practice-guide" title="Mobile Web Design and Development Best Practice Guide">read the report in full here</a><span>.</span></p>
