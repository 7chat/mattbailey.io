<p>I recently published a four part series of articles that document my front-end process at <a href="http://www.gpmd.co.uk" title="GPMD" target="_blank">GPMD</a>. They cover using <a href="http://yeoman.io/" title="Yeoman" target="_blank">Yeoman</a> to scaffold projects, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" title="Grunt JS" target="_blank">Grunt</a> to automate tasks, and <a href="https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/" title="inuit.css" target="_blank">inuit.css</a> as a CSS framework.</p>
<p>It took a while to put it all together, but I think it was really useful for my own learning. Hopefully it will help others too:</p>
