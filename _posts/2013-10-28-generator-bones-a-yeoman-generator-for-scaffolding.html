<p>I thought I&#8217;d publish a link to a little project I set up recently as it seems to be garnering some interest on Github - <a href="https://github.com/matt-bailey/generator-bones" title="generator-bones">generator-bones</a>, a <a href="http://yeoman.io/" title="Yeoman">Yeoman</a> generator for scaffolding out a basic web projects.</p>
<p>Yeoman is absolutely awesome, and if you&#8217;re not using it yet you should check it out. It comes with a <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp" title="generator-webapp">generator</a> for scaffolding web projects, but it includes a lot of things I don&#8217;t use, so I decided to create my own somewhat simplified version and include some other cool stuff that I do use - <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon" title="Grunticon">Grunticon</a> for automating your SVG workflow, and <a href="https://github.com/assemble/assemble" title="Assemble">Assemble</a> for building static HTML files from modular templates and data.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
