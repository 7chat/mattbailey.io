<p>One of the loves in my life, other than web design/dev and movies, are graphic novels. The designer in me really gets a kick out of collecting gorgeously illustrated works of art. As with my taste in films I tend to lean towards darker stories and I would like to tell you about some of my recent discoveries. So, in no particular order&#8230;</p>

<h3><a href="http://amzn.to/15CHS1K" title="Locke &amp; Key" target="_blank">Locke &amp; Key</a></h3>
<p><em>Written by Joe Hill</em><br/><em><span>Illustrated by Gabriel Rodriguez</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/15CHS1K" title="Locke &amp; Key" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="/images/dist/tumblr_inline_mqyl5euAqA1qz4rgp.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I honestly can&#8217;t recommend this series by Joe Hill highly enough. The story is a brilliantly original dark fantasy, with jaw droppingly beautiful artwork. If you check out nothing else, check this one out.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>"Locke &amp; Key tells of Keyhouse, an unlikely New England mansion, with fantastic doors that transform all who dare to walk through them&#8230; and home to a hate-filled and relentless creature that will not rest until it forces open the most terrible door of them all&#8230;"</div>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://amzn.to/13Dhz8l" title="Rachel Rising" target="_blank">Rachel Rising</a></h3>
<p><em>Written and illustrated by Terry Moore</em></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/13Dhz8l" title="Rachel Rising" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="/images/dist/tumblr_inline_mqyl5tw9Ud1qz4rgp.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is a gorgeously illustrated black and white independently published series, featuring an interesting take on the zombie genre, mixed up with a bit of Wiccan magic and demonic influence.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>"Rachel wakes up in a shallow grave. Horrified, she digs her way out and goes looking for her killer in the little town of Manson. What she finds is a trail of death following her and more than one blood-chilling suspect. Rachel Rising will haunt you for life&#8230; and death."</div>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://amzn.to/14RxOxO" title="Severed" target="_blank">Severed</a></h3>
<p><em>Written by Scott Snyder and Scott Tuft</em><br/><em><span>Illustrated by Attila Futaki</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/14RxOxO" title="Severed" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="/images/dist/tumblr_inline_mqyl62CYQ21qz4rgp.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Another genre bending piece, this one putting a spin on vampire/cannibal mythology. Dark and brooding in its tone, with a style of illustration to match.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>"1916. A man haunts the roads. A man with razor-sharp teeth and a hunger for flesh. When twelve year old Jack Garron runs away from home to find his father, a wayward minstrel who he hasn&#8217;t seen since birth, he&#8217;ll discover how quickly the American Dream can become a nightmare."</div>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://amzn.to/13DhBwQ" title="Revival" target="_blank">Revival</a></h3>
<p><em>Written by Tim Seeley</em><br/><em><span>Illustrated by Mike Norton</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/13DhBwQ" title="Revival" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="/images/dist/tumblr_inline_mqyl6cq9Mg1qz4rgp.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Yet another spin on the zombie genre (we have an innate fascination with resurrection or &#8216;life&#8217; after death it seems), but there&#8217;s also some kind of ghostly spiritual element to it as well. I adore the setting of this one - The cover describes it as a &#8220;Rural Noir&#8221; and in terms of location and atmosphere it reminds me a lot of films like Winter&#8217;s Bone and TV shows like Twin Peaks, or the French series Les Revenants (The Returned).</p>
<p>On an aside, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2521668/" title="Les Revenants (The Returned)" target="_blank">Les Revenants</a> (the TV series, not the film) is a big recommendation - deeply creepy and unsettling!</p>
<blockquote>
<div>"For one day in rural central Wisconsin the dead came back to life. Now it&#8217;s up to Officer Dana Cypress to deal with the media scrutiny, religious zealots, and government quarantine that has come with them. In a town where the living have to learn to deal with those who are supposed to be dead, Officer Cypress must solve a brutal murder, and everyone, alive or undead, is a suspect."</div>

<h3><a href="http://amzn.to/14Ry28p" title="Sweet Tooth" target="_blank">Sweet Tooth</a></h3>
<p><em>Written and Illustrated by Jeff Lemire</em></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/14Ry28p" title="Sweet Tooth" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="/images/dist/tumblr_inline_mqyl6kXHCR1qz4rgp.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What will grab you most about this one is the deeply affecting story. It&#8217;s essentially about a little &#8216;boy&#8217; (he appears to be half boy, half deer), trying to survive after some kind of catastrophic apocalypse (he describes it as &#8220;the accident&#8221;). Raised in isolation and protected by his father he has no concept of what lies outside of the woods where he lives. But when his father sadly passes away he&#8217;s left on his own to fend for himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>"The world beyond the trees is almost dead. A decade ago the affliction raged like a forrest fire, killing billions, and the only children born since are a new breed of human/animal hybrid. Gus is one of these endangered children, a boy with a sweet soul, a sweeter tooth - and the features of a deer."</div>
