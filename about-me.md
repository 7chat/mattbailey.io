<p class="lead">My name is Matt and I'm a frontend designer and developer. I'm currently Creative Director at <a href="http://www.gpmd.co.uk">GPMD</a>.</p>

If you would like to find out more about my educational and professional background, check out my [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/mattpbailey) profile. I also [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/mattbailey) occasionally and [tweet](https://twitter.com/_mattbailey) when the urge takes me.

I like clean and simple, user-centric design. I'm particularly interested in frontend processes and optimisation - If <em>Sass</em>, <em>Grunt</em>, or <em>Critical Rendering Path</em> mean anything to you then you're a kindred spirit.

Outside of work I love scary movies, graphic novels, and I'm a proud Dad.

## About This Site

From time-to-time I enjoy writing about things that interest me. This site is where I do that.

Here are some technical bits of information about my dev set-up and the site for those who are interested:

- It was created on my late 2011, souped-up (maxed out RAM, 500GB SDD) trusty MacBook Pro
- I code in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
- The terminal I use is [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/)
- I develop in [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) virtual machines
- The site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- The 'theme' is loosely based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) by [mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)
- It's hosted by [Site5](http://www.site5.com/in.php?id=107430) (who are super awesome by the way)
- The fonts I'm using are [Brandon Grotesque](https://typekit.com/fonts/brandon-grotesque) and [Jubilat](https://typekit.com/fonts/jubilat), served up by [Typekit](https://typekit.com/)
