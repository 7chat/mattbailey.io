title: About Me
---

<p class="lead">My name is Matt and I'm a frontend designer and developer. I'm currently Creative Director at <a href="http://www.gpmd.co.uk">GPMD</a>.</p>

If you would like to find out more about my educational and professional background, check out my [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/mattpbailey) profile. I also [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/mattbailey) occasionally and [tweet](https://twitter.com/_mattbailey) when the urge takes me.

I like clean and simple, user-centric design. I'm particularly interested in frontend processes and optimisation - If <em>Sass</em>, <em>Grunt</em>, or <em>Critical Rendering Path</em> mean anything to you then you're a kindred spirit.

Outside of work I love scary movies, graphic novels, and I'm a proud Dad.
